# Workshop for RNA-seq differential gene expression analyses
Welcome to this quick workshop on RNAseq for the SSRP program. There is the paired workflow that covers the entirety of the process, but here we will focus on the differential gene expression comparisons and downstream analyses. 

Additional resources can be found at:
- [The Genomics Core](http://research.njms.rutgers.edu/genomics/)
- [Amarel @ OARC](https://oarc.rutgers.edu/amarel/)
- [The Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core (your host today)](http://www.bioinformagic.io/)

*This is not meant to be comprehensive, but to serve as a baseline. Continued diving in to this is highly recommended*
